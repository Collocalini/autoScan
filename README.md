autoScan
========
This is one tool I've developed to help with my office tasks. It takes a boatload of scanned pages, skips white pages, and saves the rest into multipage pdf files, based on bookmark pages it automatically detects. There is a web-interface but it was left in a proof of concept stage, as I, personally, have no problem using command line, and my colleagues said my program didn't fit in their workflow.
